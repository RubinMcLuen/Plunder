First Mate: Captain! There ya are! Finally got yer sea legs back, aye?
First Mate: That scurvy is no funny business, you ought to spend less time on the poopdeck!
First Mate: Anyway, ship's all ready, sittin pretty at the end of the dock.
First Mate: Just holler when you're ready to set sail, I'll be there, makin' sure the rum barrel don't get lonely.
